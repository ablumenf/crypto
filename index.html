				<h4>Cryptography Overview</h4>

				<p>At a high level, DES and AES are <span class="font-italic">symmetric cryptosystems</span>. This means they use the same key for
				encryption and decryption. DES uses 64-bit keys (really just 56-bit keys; every 8th bit is used for error detection). AES has 128-bit,
				192-bit, and and 256-bit versions.</p>

				<p>DES is no longer considered secure, but it's much easier to understand than AES, so it's typically presented first. AES is a bit more
				complicated, though, since it requires some knowledge of finite fields. Like DES, it uses many rounds of low-level bit manipulations.
				Both algorithms are based on low-level bit manipulations and matrices called S-boxes, while public-key cryptography is based more on
				pure mathematics.</p>

				<p>RSA is a <span class="font-italic">public-key cryptosystem</span> (i.e., asymmetric cryptosystem), which means that separate keys
				are used for encryption and decryption. The <span class="font-italic">encryption</span> key is public. Anyone is allowed to know that.
				But the <span class="font-italic">decryption</span> key must remain private to maintain security. In practice, people use a system like
				RSA to exchange a key for use with a symmetric system like AES. This is because the lower-level calculations with AES are much faster
				than RSA. This is especially true because RSA requires many more bits of security to match AES (RSA is based on the hardness of factoring
				integers, which is hard, but perhaps not quite as hard as we might like; there are subexponential-time algorithms for factoring, but no
				known polynomial-time algorithms). For example, it is estimated that 128-bit AES is about as secure as 3072-bit RSA. This means doing
				arithmetic calculations with 3000-bit numbers (think in the ballpark of 1000-digit numbers). To match the security of 256-bit AES,
				RSA requires 15360-bit keys!</p>

				<p>ECC (elliptic curve cryptography) is much broader than a cryptosystem. There are cryptosystems, digital signatures, etc.,
				but we'll just focus on <span class="font-italic">key exchanges</span> (specifically, the Diffie-Hellman key exchange). ECC is based
				on mathematical objects called elliptic curves. The calculations are much more complicated than those needed for RSA, but the main advantage is that
				we can use <span class="font-weight-bold">much</span> smaller keys. For example, to match the security of 128-bit AES, only 256-bit keys
				are required; a huge advantage over 3072-bit RSA!</p>

				<p>There are many other interesting topics not covered here, such as (cryptographic) hashing, digital signatures, and certificate
				authorities (like Verisign). Some hashing algorithms that would be good to look up are SHA-1 and SHA-2 (SHA-1 is no longer
				considered secure). One way to do digital signatures is to take any public-key cryptosystem and sign using the private key and
				verify using the public key. There are also dedicated signature algorithms, such as the Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA)
				and Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA). For a few more cryptography resources, go to my
